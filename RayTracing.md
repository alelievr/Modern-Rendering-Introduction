# Ray Tracing

Ray tracing is is a technic that consist in computing the intersection between a ray and another primitive. This technique is used in a lot of different algorithm in rendering and provide a simple and intuitive approach to rendering.

A ray is composed of two vectors: one position and one direction.

Each intersection with a ray allows to retrieve information such as the hit position, which 3D models was hit by the ray, which triangle was hit inside the mesh. From this intersection, we can then get the mesh surface data and interpolate it.
