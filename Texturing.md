# Texturing

Texturing or [Texture Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping) is very important in rendering, it's so important that GPUs have dedicated hardware to read, filter and decompress those textures on the fly. A texture can contain any kind of data, while it is most used to store a standardized set of material attributes, it can also be used for anything else, even storing animations. Texture mapping is the process of taking a texture and applying on a mesh in a certain way. You can also see the texture mapping system as an indirection used to fetch the surface data of the object.
