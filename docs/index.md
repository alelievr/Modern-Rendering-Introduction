Welcome to the Modern Rendering Introduction course! a course designed to guide you through the essential concepts and techniques of real-time rendering. This course focuses on modern rendering technologies such as real-time hardware ray tracing, mesh shaders, physically based rendering (PBR), and more. The goal is to provide practical knowledge that serve as solid foundations to learn more complex topics later on. By understanding the core principles behind each technique, you will be well-equipped to improve and optimize them according to your needs.

## A Practical Approach

This course emphasizes straightforward implementations over theoretical complexity. While optimization is an important aspect of real-time rendering, our primary focus is on clarity and understanding. 

## Expand Your Knowledge

Rendering is a vast field, and no single course can cover everything in depth. Throughout this course, you will find references to external resources, academic papers, blog posts, documentation, and other learning materials that allow you to delve deeper into topics of interest.

## Reading Order

You do not need to follow the chapters in a strict order. The course is structured into categories to classify content, not to impose a sequential reading order. You are encouraged to explore topics based on your interests and needs, whether that means jumping directly into ray tracing, understanding mesh shaders, or materials.

## Open Source and Community Contribution

This course is open source, and contributions from the community are welcome! If you have any questions, want to discuss topics further, or propose new content, you can participate in the discussions on GitHub. Feel free to [report issues](https://github.com/alelievr/Modern-Rendering-Introduction/issues/new?template=bug_report.md), [suggest improvements](https://github.com/alelievr/Modern-Rendering-Introduction/issues/new?template=suggest-an-improvement.md), or [contribute additional content](https://github.com/alelievr/Modern-Rendering-Introduction/pulls) to help expand and refine the course for everyone.

## Getting Started
